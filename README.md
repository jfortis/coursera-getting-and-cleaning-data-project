## Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project

This proyect consists in reading the  ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform some analysis on it, and output a tidy dataset to a file.

**Steps:**

1. Copy the needed files to the R working directory with the "run_analysis.R" script:
	* `features.txt`
	* `subject_train.txt`
	* `subject_test.txt`
	* `X_train.txt`
	* `X_test.txt`
	* `y_train.txt`
	* `y_test.txt`
2. Install if needed the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html)
3. Run "run_analysis.R"

**Output**
tidy.txt

For more details, see the [Codebook](CodeBook.md).
